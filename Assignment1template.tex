\item \textbf{The Language of a 2-State DFA}

Let $M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ be a DFA and put $L = L(M)$. By considering the different
    possibilities for the set of final states $F$ of $M$, prove that if $Q$ consists of exactly
    two states, then one of the following hold (note that (b) and (c) are not mutually
    exclusive):
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $L$ is empty.
        \item $L$ contains the empty string.
        \item $L$ contains a string of length 1.
    \end{enumerate}

\textbf{Solution.}

\item \textbf{DFA Design and Analysis}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Design a DFA $M$ with at most 4 states for the language
%
\[ L = \{ w \in \{ 0, 1 \}^* \mid \text{ $w$ contains at least one 0 and $|w|$ is even\,} \}. \]
%
Present your DFA in the form of a state diagram and include a brief rationale for its
design.


\textbf{Solution.}

\newpage

\item Prove that your DFA $M$ of part (a) accepts the language $L$, i.e.\ prove that $L(M)
    = L$.

\textbf{Solution.}

\end{enumerate}

\newpage

\item \textbf{NFA Design and Analysis}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Design an NFA $N$ with at most 5 states for the language
%
\[ L = \{ w \in \{ 0, 1 \}^* \mid \text{ $w$ contains the substring $1011$ or the substring $100$\,} \}. \]
%
Present your NFA in the form of a state diagram and include a brief rationale for its
design.

\textbf{Solution.}

\newpage

\item Prove that your NFA $N$ of part (a) accepts the language $L$, i.e.\ prove that $L(N)
    = L$.
